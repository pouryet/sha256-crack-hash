# sha256-crack-hash
Hello. This code has the ability to crack different encryption methods and test all available modes as well as their combinations up to 32 characters long. The focus of this code is on Sha256, but with a small change, the type of encryption can be changed. Also remember Keep in mind that the displayed output is Unicode, and to find its main characters after finding the hash, you need to switch it out of Unicode mode. Remember, don't start the crack on your system because it will destroy it, use my server.
